pyfiction
---------

Python API for all kinds of text-based games.

Text-based games, more commonly known as interactive fiction (IF), come in various formats and use different interpreters that aren't often compatible with each other.

The goal of pyfiction is to wrap the functionality of different IF simulators and to provide a universal API for text games for research purposes.

Status: Work in progress.

Requirements:

* Linux
* Python 3.6
* `text-games <https://github.com/MikulasZelinka/text-games>`_ submodule (only for two games - Saving John and Machine of Death).
