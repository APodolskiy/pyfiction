Well, that's all the essentials, so you pay for your items, and head back out into the mall.   On your way to one of the exits, the clinking of change bouncing around your pocket distracts you. Perhaps you should treat yourself to something? You stop walking and take a look around.   Peak hour ended an hour or so ago, alleviating the feeling of being a tinned sardine that’s commonly associated with shopping malls, though there are still quite a few people busily bumbling about.

You're carrying 5 dollars in change."), (28.3, 'The poster is advertising the upcoming tour of stand-up comedian Phil Bison, also known as the Cancer Comic.  Before the Machine hit, jokes about fatal illnesses were considered “edgy” and politically incorrect, often leading to controversy. Now they’re as common as knock, knock jokes.  Of course, modern comedians only get away with it because of their slips. As his stage name suggests, Bison received one of the more straight forward machine results: CANCER. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out what themes he explores with his humour.  Some are of the opinion that it’s healthy for people to laugh at their own tragedies, believing it’s a valuable coping mechanism. Others accuse it of being exploitive.  It doesn\'t help that there was once a comedian who "faked his own death," claiming he was going to die from an HIV infection. At the height of his fame, he was constantly surrounded by people, something he seemed to treasure. When it was discovered he lied about his death, his career was instantly destroyed.  His slip actually said ISOLATION.   '), (28.5, "You approach The Machine, which has the very charming street name of The Machine of Death.  The device has only been around for a few years, but it's already hard to imagine a world without it, as it completely reshaped it, creating a culture of death. Well, others feel that it created a culture of life, despite it clearly ruining a few people's. Here's how it works: a person inserts a dollar and sticks their finger in the machine, which takes a blood sample. A little card is then spat out, which reveals the persons final fate.  Of course, it's not that simple. The machine is always 100% accurate, but the cards are often obtuse and even misleading, such as the tragic person who received PEANUTS, spent years avoiding the faux nut, only to have a box full of Snoopy comics fall on top of and kill them.   Events like this have led some to believe that the machine has a sense of humour. You never did get yourself tested. Maybe today is the day.  "), (28.2, 'You move around to the side of the machine and read the slip of paper:  XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX '), (28.3, "You wander over to the UFO catcher and peek at what's trapped behind the glass.

It looks delightfully cuddly in all it's green glory."), (28.2, 'You manoeuvre the crane over the tiny dino, lower and clasp the jaws around it, and lift it back up... only for it to fall from the crane’s frustratingly weak grasp.

"), (28.5, 'You insert your finger, wince slightly at the jab, then pick up and read the card that’s quickly spat out.  SHOT THROUGH THE HEART BY BON JOVI YEARS LATER... You finally arrive at Rachel\'s house, a two-story villa overlooking the beach. Well, it actually belongs to her father, but he lets her have this one since he has another three dotted along the coast.  Rachel is what some people call a "trust fund kid." Despite her wealth, she still has a job, which is how you met her. Your desk is across from hers.  Some of your other co-workers warned you about her, describing her as a bit of a wild one. But "weird" and "crazy" are often words boring people use to describe interesting ones.  But hey, she invited you out with some of her friends, and you could do with a fun night out. It\'s been far too long since the last one.  You pull up into the drive way and approach the front door. '), (28.5, 'Before you even finish knocking, Rachel almost rips the door from its hinges.  "Hey, come in!" she excitedly shrills, her blonde hair dancing on her shoulders, where they meet the top of a long, understated black dress. You greet and follow her into the lounge room, which is about the size of a restaurant. A large restaurant. It\'s complete with a bar and ludicrously large entertainment system.  She gestures about the room as she hastily walks towards the stairs. "Sit wherever you like!" she insists.     '), (28.5, 'You pick a sofa from the wide selection and plump yourself down on it. It feels like real leather.  Rachel begins to ascend the stairs. "I\'m running a little late, sorry! Give me another couple minutes. Bon Jovi will keep you company."  Your eye twitches involuntarily. If The Machine is to be believed, the song Shot Through the Heart by American rock band Bon Jovi will signify your death. And The Machine is always to be believed.  "Here he comes!" Rachel yells from the second floor. You look towards the bottom of the stairs and see a small, ginger Pomeranian waddle down them and towards you.  "Hello," the furry creature says as he looks up at you. "I\'m Bon Jovi!"       '), (28.4, '"This isn\'t a dog and pony show!" He pauses, perhaps for dramatic effect, and then bursts into song and dance. You recognise the tune as the early 90s hit, I\'ll Sleep When I\'m Dead.  He yawns and lies down on the floor after his energetic performance. "Actually, I\'m getting pretty sleepy now." '), (28.5, 'Shock shatters the miniature rock star\'s face before it’s quickly replaced with hurt. You almost feel like apologising, but before you can, Bon Jovi stares you straight in the eyes and says "Don\'t. The damage is done."  With his head lowered, he slowly trundles off to his bed, curls up, and gives you puppy dog eyes before falling asleep, moments before Rachel bounds down the stairs with her usual energy.  "He\'s a cutie, isn\'t he?" she says as she leans down and pets Bon Jovi. "I\'m dogsitting him for my friend. She was supposed to come with us tonight." A sudden realisation hits her. "Oh, my friends bailed," she reveals. "But it\'s okay, we\'ll either make new friends there or have fun on our own!"  "Time to go!" Rachel announces as she grabs your arm and pulls you outside, where the two of you get in your car.  "You like karaoke, right?" she asks, as you begin to drive to the address she gave you.     '), (28.5, '"Great! Because that\'s exactly where we\'re going." A huge smile conquers her face. "It\'s one of my favourite places in the world.”  You drive past a billboard advertising the latest Machine of Death. Some clever graffiti makes it read "Death to the Machine of Death." It looks like you\'ve wandered into one of THOSE neighbourhoods.  You eventually arrive at the bar, which appears to be the kind of questionable repute. Half the lights of its neon name tag aren\'t functioning, the bin outside is overflowing, and a row of motorcycles are lined up next to it.  "I\'ve no idea what I\'m going to sing first," Rachel excitedly mutters to no one in particular as she hurries out of the car and towards the bar’s entrance.  You almost impulsively dash after her, when you suddenly remember something. In your glove box is a gun, which you keep handy for all potential Bon Jovi related emergencies.    '), (28.5, "You decided that you don't need a firearm. You already have a set of guns sitting below your shoulders, after all.  You get out of your car and enter the bar with Rachel. The sound of a trio of women singing a drunken rendition of Wannabe by the Spice Girls hits you like a brick in the face.  After the initial aural shock wears off, you look around and examine your surroundings. It is quite possibly the tackiest bar you've ever been in. There's low lighting, pictures of famous singers cover the wall, Christmas lights arranged into flower and love heart shapes hang from the ceiling, and it's a little sticky where you're standing.  That said, it doesn't appear to be the dangerous, scum-dwelling establishment its exterior suggests. It’s full of joyous people drinking, swaying and singing.  You take a moment to relish the drunken merriment. Then, in a corner, you see rock idol Jon Bon Jovi.  "), (28.5, 'You launch yourself at Jon Bon Jovi and tackle him to the ground! It\'s at this point you realise that it\'s only a cardboard standee. You stand up and look around. Everyone is silently staring at you with wide eyes.  "Uh, haha, my friend is a really huge fan of Jovi!” Rachel nervously explains. "Just had to hug him!" An "Ooh!" sweeps over the crowd and they return to their merry ways.  "What the hell was that?" asks Rachel, clearly trying to restrain anger.    '), (28.5, 'She smiles, though a quizzical expression remains on her face.  "Well, try to relax and enjoy yourself. I\'m supposed to be the crazy one, remember?"  As you walk by the standee towards a table, you stop in your tracks as a familiar melody flows from the speakers. You turn to the stage to see a middle-aged businessman begin to belt out the most terrifying words you could ever here.  "Shot... through the heart... it\'s all part... of the game that we call love!"  A man walking past you suddenly halts and screams "STOP!" at the top of his lungs. It\'s effective; though the music keeps playing, all the people in the bar turn to look at him.  He grabs the nearest chair and starts flailing it wildly around! "Turn the music off!" he screams. "I\'m not ready yet!"     '), (28.5, 'You grab Jovi and hold him out in front of you at arm’s length. The man stares at it with menace in his eyes, snarling "You."   He swings at the standee, knocking the head clean off Jon Bon Jovi\'s shoulders, moments before a group of patrons rush to restrain the chair man.  You feel someone grab your arm, and look over to see that it’s Rachel. "Let\'s get out of here," she says while motioning towards the exit.  You charge out of the bar and leap back into your car, adrenaline still pumping through your veins. As you slam the door, the glove box pops open and reveals your gun.    '), (-1.0999999999999999, 'Rachel hops into the passenger seat and immediately notices the gun. "What the hell is that?" she asks, her voice laced with fear. Before you can even explain, she gets out of the car. "Stay the hell away from me!" she blurts as she disappears into the crowd emerging from the bar.  You begin the long drive home. To break the silence, you turn the radio on.  "Shot... through the heart... it\'s all part... of the game that we call love!"  THE END    '), (28.0, 'You stand back and watch others approach the machine. A male who looks to be in his mid-to-late twenties approaches the machine, shaking.   He inserts a coin, has his finger jabbed, and picks up the ticket that\'s printed shortly afterwards. With reluctance, he reads it and a wave of relief rolls across his body. He wipes sweat from his brow and walks away, still a little shaken, but not stirred.  "Doing a bit of deathspotting, huh?" You turn around and see a young woman, maybe not even quite in her twenties, with azure blue hair and red rimmed glasses, and sporting a simple, black work uniform.  Deathspotting? Yeah. Nah.'), (28.0, 'She raises an eyebrow at you. "You know, watching how people react to their tickets and trying to guess their deaths." She begins to munch on a turkey sandwich. "It\'s how I kill time on my lunch break."   "Take that last guy. He seemed pretty relieved when he looked at his ticket. I\'m going to guess that he\'s been feeling a burning sensation when peeing lately." She giggles gleefully to herself.  The machine is often used as a self-diagnosing tool. Instead of going to a doctor, they would just get a jabbed to see if they were suffering from anything serious. This practice was naturally met with much disapproval from medical professionals.  "Check it out, here comes some more," she says as she chews on her sandwich.  A group of teenagers approach the machine with jovial spirits, egging one of their friends on to get jabbed, then cheer deafeningly as he does so. He pulls out a slip and they all begin to laugh, the jabbed laughing as he seemingly mimes his own head exploding.  "So," the deathspotter asks before taking another bite of her sandwich, "What do you think he got?"        '), (27.9, 'She rolls her eyes. "That\'s not very fun," she begins. "And also very unoriginal. Be imaginative!" She jams some more turkey in her mouth while pointing at someone else approaching the Machine. "Here\'s another one."  A middle-aged woman approaches the machine and gets her finger jabbed. She hesitates before reading her slip, finally relenting and peering at the uppercase letters that will set her fate in stone. She begins to cry.  After a brief moment of silence, the nameless deathspotter speaks. "Let\'s not guess that one. This can be a depressing hobby sometimes." She nibbles her turkey sandwich a little more and turns to you. "So, have you been jabbed?"    '), (28.0, 'She shrugs, saying "Suit yourself." She finishes off her sandwich and walks away, disappearing into the crowd.  '), (28.5, 'You plump yourself on one of the barstools and give yourself a spin.  Rachel begins to ascend the stairs.

"I wouldn\'t even know what to do with a gun if I found one."'), (28.4, '"Oh, I hope not," Bon Jovi says with a look of mild concern. "Insanity isn\'t nearly as glamorous as the movies portray it. In fact, it\'s usually quite tragic for all involved." '), (28.099999999999998, 'You excuse yourself and move away from the dog. "Don\'t be a little runaway!" Bon Jovi insists. "We ain\'t gonna live forever! Stay and talk!"  Both you and Bon Jovi become distracted by Rachel bounding down the stairs with her usual energy. '), (28.5, 'You decide to play it cool, and ignore your potential assailant.  You notice everyone else is also ignoring him, which is a bit odd considering his level of fame. You look over to him again and realise it\'s only a cardboard standee.  Standees don\'t have much of a history of gun violence, so you relax. You look around and see Rachel beckoning over to her.  Despite your efforts to hide your initial concern, it seems it didn\'t work quite well enough. "Are you okay?" Rachel asks with a concerned raised eyebrow.    '), (28.5, 'Her eyes widen as you reveal your fate to her. "Why didn\'t you tell me this earlier?" she exclaims. "This is the worst place for you to be! Almost all of Bon Jovi’s songs are up for singing here! Come on, we\'ll go somewhere else."  She grabs your arm and pulls you towards the exit.

THE END'), (28.3, 'The restaurant is a Deady\'s, a fast food chain that quickly cropped up across the world after the Machine became an international pop sensation.  Their slogan is “You Only Live Once!” which, when translated from marketing speak and into English, basically means “You know how you’re going to die, so until then you may as well enjoy yourself by clogging your arteries with as much of our disgustingly/deliciously unhealthy food as possible.”  People who pulled FOOD PIOSONING from the Machine receive a card that gives them a permanent 5% discount.
